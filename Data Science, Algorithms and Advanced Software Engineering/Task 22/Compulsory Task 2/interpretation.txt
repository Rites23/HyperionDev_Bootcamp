Countries that lie on the fringes of the clusters are more prone to move to the next than countries that are closer to the centroids or 
means of a particular cluster. This observation however, is dependent on how much the centroids will move from beginning to end (as they are chosen randomly). 
This observation also excludes the outer fringes of the clusters on the outside of the dataset, in this case, the outer fringes of clusters 3 and 2. 
I have also noticed in the end that when it comes to the variable values of “Birth Rate” and “Life Expectancy”, countries that fall within a certain range 
of values, tend to end up in the same clusters. The value range of these pairs per cluster though are not equal. 
This analysis falls in line with what we said we should achieve in the end, which is high intra-cluster similarity and low inter-cluster similarity.
