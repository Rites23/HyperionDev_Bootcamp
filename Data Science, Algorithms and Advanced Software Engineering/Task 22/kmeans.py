#K-Means clustering implementation

#Some hints on how to start, as well as guidance on things which may trip you up, have been added to this file.
#You will have to add more code that just the hints provided here for the full implementation.
#You will also have to import relevant libraries for graph plotting and maths functions.

# ====
# Define a function that computes the distance between two data points



# ====
# Define a function that reads data in from the csv files  
# HINT: http://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html. 
# HINT2: Remember that CSV files are comma separated, so you should use a "," as a delimiter. 
# HINT3: Ensure you are reading the csv file in the correct mode.



# ====
# Define a function that finds the closest centroid to each point out of all the centroids
# HINT: This function should call the function you implemented that computes the distance between two data points.
# HINT: Numpy has a useful method that allows you to find the index of the smallest value in an array. 


#====
#Write a function to visualise the clusters. (optional, but useful to see the changes and if your algorithm is working)



#====
# Write the initialisation procedure 


         
#====
# Implement the k-means algorithm, using appropriate looping for the number of iterations
# --- find the closest centroid to each point and assign the point to that centroid's cluster
# --- calculate the new mean of all points in that cluster
# --- visualise (optional, but useful to see the changes)
#---- repeat




# ====
# Print out the results for questions
#1.) The number of countries belonging to each cluster
#2.) The list of countries belonging to each cluster
#3.) The mean Life Expectancy and Birth Rate for each cluster
