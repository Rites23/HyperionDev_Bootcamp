Discuss any ambiguities or omissions in the statement of
requirements for the part of a ticket-issuing system:

- How should the system respond if a invalid card is used?
- Will the customer be able to cancel a request if a mistake has been made?
- Can a customer buy several tickets for the same destination together or must they be bought individually?
- What kind of input device (Touchscreen or Keyboard) does the system support?
- Does it print a receipt for ticket details? 
- Must the customer press the start button again if they wish to purchase another ticket to a different destination? 
- What would happen should a customer try to put in their card before selecting a destination? 
- Train departure and arrival times. Will customers have to buy tickets for a specific train, or for any trip along the route? 

Write a set of non-functional requirements for the ticket-issuing
system above. You are free to make assumptions regarding the
system based on ambiguities or omissions you identified previously.

- After the customer presses a button on the machine, the display should be updated within 0.5 seconds.
- The ticket issuing time after credit card validation has been received should not exceed 10 seconds.
- When validating credit cards, the display should provide a status message for customers indicating that activity is taking place.
  This tells the customer that the potentially time consuming activity of validation is still in progress and that the system has not simply failed.
- The system shall continue to function as long as there is roll of ticket paper in the machine, and a network connection is provided for the destination database and credit transactions.
- Upon receipt of the destination from the user, the database shall be accessed to determine the distance from the unitâ€™s location, to the desired destination, and calculate the appropriate fee.
