Use this table to illustrate one of each kind of anomaly described in the
task. In a text file called anomalies.txt, how you would change the table
and which anomaly that change would create.

Update anomalies: Occurs when the same information is recorded in multiple rows.

- In the PROD_NUM table, if the product number changes, then there are multiple updates that need to be made. If these
  updates are not successfully completed across all rows, then an inconsistency occurs.

Insertion anomalies: When there is data we cannot record until we know information for the entire row.

- We cannot record a new INV_NUM until we also know the PROD_NUM, in order to create the record, we need to provide a primary key. 

Deletion anomalies: When deletion of a row can cause more than one set of facts to be removed.

- If removimg an INV_NUM, there will inconsistency especially if there was more then one entry. The data would be incorrect.
