Discrete Variable - A variable is called discrete when its domain consist of some distinct values. 
For example a variable whose domain is {1,2,3,4} is a discrete variable.

Continuous Variable - A variable is called continuous when its domain consist of uncountable number of values. 
For example a variable whose domain is in range of two real numbers.

Case 1:

Explanatory Variable :
Size of land - continuous variable

Linear regression is suited for this problem because dependent variable i.e. price of land is continuous in nature.

Case 2:

Explanatory Variable :
Presence of the word prize - It is discrete as it can have a value either true or false.
Presence of word win - It is discrete as it can have a value either true or false.
Spelling errors - It is discrete as it can have a value either true or false.

Logistic regression is suited for this problem because the dependent variable i.e. spam classification can be true or false 
only representing spam and not spam respectively.

Case 3:

Explanatory Variable :
Time after expiry: It is a discretre variable and can have either true or false representing sour and not sour.

Logistic regression is suited for this problem because the dependent variable i.e. status of milk.
