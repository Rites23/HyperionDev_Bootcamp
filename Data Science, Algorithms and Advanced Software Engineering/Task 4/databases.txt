Explain the difference between data and information.

- Data describes raw pieces of input with no context or meaning.
- Information is processed and formatted data that can now be used to find patterns in the data, or even be able to make predictions
  based on picked-up trends. In order to do this, though, the data itself needs to be
  accurate and formatted in a way that makes it possible to process correctly.
 
Research “sparse data”. What is the alternative? What are the differences between the two?

- An alternative would be dense data. 
- "sparse" and "dense" often refer to the number of zero vs. non-zero elements in an array (e.g. vector or matrix). 
  A sparse array is one that contains mostly zeros and few non-zero entries. A dense array contains mostly non-zeros.

Look up “transaction consistency”. Describe it in your own words.

- It is the highest level of isolation that allows an application to read only commited data and guarantees that the transaction 
  has a consistent view of the database, as though no other transactions were active. It will be read locked until the transaction ends. 
  
Given the file below, answer the following questions:
○ How many records does the file contain?
○ How many fields are there per record?

- The file contains five records (21-5U through 29-7P) and each of the records is composed of five fields (PROJECT_CODE through PROJECT_BID_PRICE.).
