# HyperionDev_Bootcamp

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Software Engineer coding bootcamp! This repository contains all the projects, tasks, and exercises that I completed during the course. The bootcamp is focused on teaching the fundamentals of programming and building professional applications in software engineering and web development.

## About the Bootcamp

The bootcamp is a 6-month, part-time program that focuses on hands-on learning and real-world projects. Throughout the program, I worked on various tasks that included instructional PDFs, code examples, and final projects that allowed me to demonstrate my coding skills.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains a series of tasks that I completed during the bootcamp. Each task is stored in its own folder and contains the following:

- **Instructional PDF**: Explains the concepts and steps for completing the task.
- **Example Code**: A sample solution or starting point for the task.
- **Additional Notes**: Any notes or explanations I created during the task.
- **Compulsory Projects**: Final projects that were required to progress to the next task.

Each task corresponds to a key concept that was crucial for learning programming and web development.

## How to Navigate the Repository

- **Each folder** represents a task completed during the bootcamp. 
- **Project files** are contained inside these folders.

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java & Python
- GitHub, IntelliJ & VS Code

## Learning Outcomes

During the bootcamp, I learned the following:

- **Programming Fundamentals**: Gaining a solid understanding of key programming concepts like variables, loops, functions, etc.
- **Full-Stack Development**: Building web applications with front-end and back-end integration.
- **Problem-Solving**: Using coding to solve real-world problems and challenges.
- **Version Control**: Learning how to manage code using Git and GitHub.
