Compulsory Task

1. Potential problematic situations are in brackets []

   Individuals and interactions over processes and tools [egos, incompetent, individuals on the team, bad relationships]

   Working software over comprehensive documentation ['skills walkout' i.e. team changing, low level of competence creating too many errors that are hard to track]

   Customer collaboration over contract negotiation [relationships breakdown]

   Responding to change over following a plan [transient and circular change]

2. Agile is a team driven iterative approach to development where the users and product owner are constantly involved with the development team during the entire project life cycle.
   Uses simple adaptable processes.
   Methodologies include Extreme Programming (XP), Scrum, Crystal, Dynamic Systems, Development Method (DSDM), Lean Development, Feature-Driven Development (FDD)

3. The world is always changing; communication gaps between users and developers.

4. Test-first development requires a clear relationship between system requirements and the code implementing the corresponding requirements.
   The task implementers have to thoroughly understand the specifications so that they can write tests for the system.
   Sometimes the programmers will take shortcuts writing tests.
