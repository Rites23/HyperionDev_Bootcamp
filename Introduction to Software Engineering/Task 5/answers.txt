The code is not exactly readable as is. It makes use of the Math.random function asking the user 5 simple random substraction equations. 
The numbers in the equation will all be within 10. 
This is done in a while loop. It provides the output according to what the user has entered. 

Once the code runs we determine the above. It does a substraction loop. If you enter an incorrect answer it will notify you 
and vice versa as well.
