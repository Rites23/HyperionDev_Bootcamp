Task 2

1.  Plagiarism is copying the words or ideas of others without giving them credit (that is, presenting someone else's work as your own).   It is cheating, and it is theft.

2.  Direct plagiarism - is the word-for-word transcription of a section of someone else's work, without attribution and without quotation marks.
    
    Example: Copying large pieces of text from a source without citing that source. 
             
             Turning in someone else's work as your own.

    Self-plagiarism - is any attempt to take any of your own previously published text, papers, or research results and make it appear brand new.
 
    Example: Treating anything you've previously written as if it were new material.

             Using a substantial amount of a paper written for another course as content for a new assignment.
   
    Mosaic plagiarism - occurs when one borrows phrases from a source without using quotation marks, or finds synonyms for the author's language while keeping to the same general structure and meaning of the original.

    Example: You find a paper similar to your assignment and change some wording so that it isn’t a direct copy, though the ideas, information and/or organization are not original.

             Using work completed by someone else, then reorganizing it or adding extra text to what was there to start with.

    Accidental plagiarism - occurs when a person neglects to cite their sources, or misquotes their sources, or unintentionally paraphrases a source by using similar words, groups of words, and/or sentence structure without attribution.

    Example: Failure to cite a source that is not common knowledge.

             Failure to "quote" or block quote author's exact words, even if cited.
      
             Failure to put a paraphrase in your own words, even if cited.

             Failure to put a summary in your own words, even if cited.

             Failure to be loyal to a source.

3.  Submit your own work and be sure to reference anyone else’s work that you are using. Its best to put in the hard work now to avoid playing catch up later on.
